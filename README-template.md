## My process
I started by creating the html template then i worked my way through to CSS. I initially used mobile first approach but i got confused on the way so i switched over to desktop first. After creating the desktop first, i encountered some problems using the @media-query screen size =(min-width:375px); so i had to use the tablet size which (max-width:620px), still having the mobile size in mind.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

i learnt a great to use image property object fit. I also learnt how to properly structure my html codes. i didnt use much of html semantic because i havent quite mastered it but i will make sure to implement it in my next design.
i also learnt how to center div element. i learnt how to make web project responsive.

``css
.img2{
    display:block;
    object-fit: cover; 
}
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I would definitely love to focus more on media queries, i havent quite mastered it. Also, i would like to improve on perfectly centering a div. These were my major challenges. i would focus on using html semantics in my project for SEO purposes.
